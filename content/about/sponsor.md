# Became a sponsor
If you or your company rely on my work, then sponsoring my work will be a win-win situation for both of us. I get to focus on delivering more value, and you get the peace of mind that Japa and other open-source projects of mine are well maintained.

## How to sponsor?
You can [sponsor my open source work](https://github.com/sponsors/thetutlage) on Github. Both monthly recurring subscriptions and one-time donations are accepted. Recurring subscriptions are entitled to the benefits mentioned in the tiers section.

Also, you will receive the invoices for the payments directly from Github.

## Sponsoring as an individual
If you enjoy using Japa, AdonisJS, Edge, or any other of my open-source projects, consider donating as a sign of appreciation. If you decide to pay a monthly recurring amount, you can also access the premium learning content, sponsorware, and paid packages.

## Sponsoring as a business
If you are building revenue-generating products using Japa, AdonisJS, or Edge, it makes business sense to sponsor these projects. As a result, the project that your product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained.

If you are building a product where your target customers are developers, then consider the **Advertisement tier** to place your logo in front of thousands of developers visiting my open source projects every month.
